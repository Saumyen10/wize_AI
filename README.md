Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, and Topic Classification Pipeline
Project Overview
This project implements a pipeline to scrape articles by a specific author, clean the data, and classify topics using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The pipeline processes articles for a well-organized dataset structured around key themes.

Features
Web Scraping: Extracts articles written by a specific author across multiple pages, handling pagination and dynamic loading.
Data Cleaning: Processes and cleans text to remove irrelevant content, normalize formatting, and standardize metadata.
Topic Classification: Categorizes articles into predefined topics, utilizing NLP techniques for accurate classification.
Requirements
Programming Language: Python 3.x
Libraries:
requests, BeautifulSoup4, Selenium: For web scraping.
pandas: For data manipulation and storage.
sklearn (scikit-learn): For NLP-based topic classification.
nltk or spaCy: For text preprocessing (optional, but useful for advanced NLP).
Installation
Install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium pandas scikit-learn nltk spacy

Usage
1. Web Scraping
The scraper.py script collects articles by the author across multiple pages of a specified website. It uses BeautifulSoup or Selenium to navigate and extract content.

Run the scraper:

bash
Copy code
python scraper.py
Note: Update the target URL and author name in scraper.py before running the script.

2. Data Cleaning
The data_cleaning.py script removes unnecessary content like ads, extraneous HTML tags, and unwanted phrases from the scraped articles. It also ensures uniform formatting for fields like Title, Content, and Date.

Run data cleaning:

bash
Copy code
python data_cleaning.py
3. Topic Classification
The topic_classification.py script uses NLP techniques to categorize each article. CountVectorizer is used for feature extraction, and Naive Bayes, SVM, or LDA is used for topic classification.

Run topic classification:

bash
Copy code
python topic_classification.py
Detailed Steps
Web Scraping:

Uses requests or Selenium to access pages, handle pagination, and extract articles based on HTML structure.
Stores scraped data as a list of dictionaries.
Data Cleaning:

Extracts main article content while removing ads, comments, and irrelevant text.
Normalizes text (e.g., lowercase conversion, punctuation removal).
Handles missing or malformed data and ensures structured format (title, date, content).
Topic Classification:

Converts articles to a vectorized format using CountVectorizer.
Applies classification algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM) for supervised learning or LDA for unsupervised topic modeling.
Achieves target classification accuracy and outputs a structured dataset.
Output
The final dataset (articles.csv) includes:

Title: Title of the article.
Content: Cleaned article content.
Date: Publication date of the article.
Topic: Classified topic label.
Example Output
csv
Copy code
Title,Content,Date,Topic
"Introducing Nutrify", "Whole food nutrition tracking powered by computer vision", "May 28", "Technology"
"Apple M3 Machine Learning Speed Test", "Apple M3 performance on TensorFlow and PyTorch", "Jan 9", "Machine Learning"
...
Customization
Author Name: Update the target author’s name in scraper.py.
Topics: Modify topic categories in topic_classification.py to suit your data.
Scraping Settings: Adjust pagination, dynamic loading, and rate limits to comply with the target website's policies.
Known Limitations
Website Structure Changes: The scraper relies on the website’s current HTML structure, which may change.
Model Accuracy: Topic classification model accuracy may vary based on training data volume and quality.
